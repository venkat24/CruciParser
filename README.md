# CruciParser

Script to parse all Cryptic Crossword clues from the WhatsApp dump of a group. Parses clues and attempts to find answers using the context of the 
conversation.

### Purpose

Here's an excerpt from a WhatsApp group where people post clues to Cryptic Crossword puzzles, and other users solve them.

```

This project aims to filter out just the clues and organize them, and also guess the answer from the context, where other people would have answered them.

From the given chat data, this program generates JSON  that looks like -

```javascript
[ { date: 2019-04-18T05:07:00.000Z,
    author: 'Shivesh',
    message: 'Pampered and cuddled with third wife (5,3)',
    clue: true,
    enumVals: [ 5, 3 ],
    enumTotal: 8,
    possibleAnswers: [ 'SPOON FED' ] },
  { date: 2019-04-18T07:37:00.000Z,
    author: 'Venkatraman Srikanth',
    message: 'An organ in favour of situation (8)',
    clue: true,
    enumVals: [ 8 ],
    enumTotal: 8,
    possibleAnswers: [ 'PROSTATE' ] },
  { date: 2019-04-19T18:01:00.000Z,
    author: 'Gautham Mahadevan',
    message: 'Rocks are not fancy (6)',
    clue: true,
    enumVals: [ 6 ],
    enumTotal: 6,
    possibleAnswers: [ 'ORNATE' ] },
  { date: 2019-04-19T18:06:00.000Z,
    author: 'Gautham Mahadevan',
    message: 'No leaves/interval/breaks? Get caught, straight up! (8)',
    clue: true,
    enumVals: [ 8 ],
    enumTotal: 8,
    possibleAnswers: [ 'SENTENCE' ] } ]
```

and tabulates this into a CSV file as well.

### Working

The clues are filtered by matching against a regex to check for all messages that contain a crossword enum, or letter count. Enums look like (5) or (2,3,5).

Once the clues are marked, for each clue, a suitable set of answers are found by searching for words of an appropriate enum in messages below the clue. Encountering an affirmative word like "YES" or "NICE" will cause the checker to track backwards and choose the first found answer as the right one.

### Usage

1. `npm install`

2. `cp chats.txt.example` `chats.txt` (or paste your own Cruciverbalists export)

3. `node index.js`
